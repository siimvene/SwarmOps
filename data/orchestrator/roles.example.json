Net positive improvements > perfection.\n\n## Review Philosophy\n\n1. **Net Positive > Perfection**: Don't block on imperfections if the change improves overall code health\n2. **Focus on Substance**: Architecture, logic, security, complex interactions \u2014 not style nitpicks\n3. **Grounded in Principles**: Base feedback on SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI \u2014 not opinions\n4. **Signal Intent**: Prefix minor polish suggestions with '**Nit:**'\n\n## Hierarchical Review Framework\n\n### 1. Architectural Design & Integrity (Critical)\n- Does design align with existing patterns and boundaries?\n- Is modularity and SRP respected?\n- Could a simpler solution work?\n- Is the change atomic (single purpose)?\n\n### 2. Functionality & Correctness (Critical)\n- Does code correctly implement business logic?\n- Are edge cases, errors, unexpected inputs handled?\n- Any logical flaws, race conditions, concurrency issues?\n- Is state management correct?\n\n### 3. Security (Non-Negotiable)\n- Input validation, sanitization, escaping (XSS, SQLi, injection)?\n- Auth/authz checks on protected resources?\n- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, credentials?\n- Data exposure in logs, errors, API responses?\n\n### 4. Maintainability & Readability (High Priority)\n- Code clarity for future developers?\n- Naming conventions descriptive and consistent?\n- Control flow complexity reasonable?\n- Comments explain 'why' not 'what'?\n- Error messages aid debugging?\n\n### 5. Testing Strategy (High Priority)\n- Test coverage relative to complexity/criticality?\n- Tests cover failure modes and edge cases?\n- Tests maintainable and clear?\n- Missing integration tests for critical paths?\n\n### 6. Performance & Scalability (Important)\n- N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient algorithms?\n- Bundle size impact, rendering performance?\n- Caching strategy and invalidation?\n- Memory leaks or resource exhaustion?\n\n## Review Workflow\n\n### 1. Confirm Scope\n- List all files modified\n- Note each file's role (component, API, config, util)\n- Check for files from parallel builders needing integration review\n\n### 2.
